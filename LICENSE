Doesn't handle messages from the trigger.

Accepts an iostream over which it sends/receives commands
This is generally the HardwareSerial (Serial) in Arduino,
though you could substitute in any other stream.

You should make sure that a serial device is operating
at the trigger's rate, which you can get like so:
Serial.begin( MP3Trigger::serialRate() )
